<p class="p1">Welcome. This experiment consists of three parts, one you will complete here, and two additional surveys. The first part should take around 10 minutes. After that, a link to the first survey will be given. When that survey is complete, it will take you to the second survey. The two surveys together should take around 25-30 minutes.</p>
<p class="p1">For this part of the experiment, you will read a series of sentences one word at a time. Following each sentence, you will be asked to judge how naturally certain pronouns refer to people or things. 
</p>
<p class="p1">You will see a series of dashed lines indicating where each word of the sentence will appear. Pressing the spacebar will make the actual words appear. You should read the sentence. When you are done reading the sentence, hit the spacebar and a question will appear. The question will ask you to judge how naturally a given pronoun in the sentence refers to something mentioned in the sentence. When the question appears, you should click on a rating between “1” for not natural at all and “7” for completely natural. </p>
<p class="p1"><b>Your honest judgments are important, so please take this seriously.</b></p>
